# Villager Jackets

Villager Jackets is an extremely lightweight way to make those useless villagers (and nitwits) a little more useful - by crafting special jackets for each type of villager, you can easily change a villager's career and even refresh trades for a villager who already has the same type of career!
### Installation
Like any other plugin, simply drag and drop into the plugins folder.

### Crafting
The crafting recipe for each type of jacket is simple. Start by making a leather chestplate, then replace the item in the very center with the right material for the right kind of villager.
